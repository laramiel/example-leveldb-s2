
Google's S2 library nominally lives on code.google.com at <https://code.google.com/archive/p/s2-geometry-library/>

However that version has not been updated in several years.

So what's a soul to do? Fork & commit to git, of course.

We also rely on the BUILD file from <https://github.com/xygroup/s2>
as a starting point for our own BUILD file.
